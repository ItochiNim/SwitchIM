# SwitchIM
AutoHotKey script to switch layouts with a key and input methods with another.<br/>

This script was made to allow windows user to switch between layouts in an easier way<br/>

In my case I have 3 layouts English, Japanese, Korean.<br/>
In windows you need to press Windows key + Spacebar to switch between layouts<br/>
Japanese need Alt + \` to switch input method to hiragana<br/>
Korean need AltGR to swith input method to hangul.<br/>

This script looks to simplify that using LeftCtrl key to switch layouts<br/>
and AltGR key to switch input methods.<br/>
