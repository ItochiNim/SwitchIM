# SwitchIM
AutoHotKey script to switch layouts with a key and input methods with another.<br/>

This script was made some time ago to allow myself to switch between layouts and input methods in an easier way<br/>
never thought about sharing it, but maybe someone can find it useful.<br/>

In my case I have 3 layouts `English`, `Japanese` and `Korean`.<br/>
In windows you need to press `Windows` + `Spacebar` to switch between layouts<br/>
Japanese need `Alt` + \` to switch input method to `Hiragana`<br/>
Korean need `AltGR` to swith input method to `Hangul`.<br/>

This script looks to simplify that using `LeftCtrl` to switch layouts<br/>
and `AltGR` to switch input methods.<br/>

### How to use it

Method 1:
Download & Run the `SwithIM.ahk` file.
With `AutoHotKey` installed.

Method 2:
Download & Run `SwitchIM.exe` file.
Exe file packed by `AutoHotKey`.

### Trying it out

Press `LeftCtrl` if you have more than one layout it'll switch to the next one.<br/>
If you have japanese layout installed press `LeftCtrl` until japanese is selected, `Click` where you want to type, press `AltGR` to cycle between `Hiragana` and `Romaji`.<br/>
If you have the korean layout installed press `Left Ctrl` until korean is selected, `Click` where you want to type, press `AltGR` to cycle between `Hangul` and `Romaja`<br/>

### You can make it start with windows

Windows 10/11<br/>
Press `windows` + `R` and type `shell:startup` it will open a folder, paste a shortcut to `SwitchIM.ahk` or `SwitchIM.exe` Done!

### Compatibility

This was tested and is working on Windows 10/11.
